Using Java with the Spring framework makes it quite straightforward to implement RESTful APIs. Here's how you can proceed with Java Spring:

1. Set Up Your Project:
   - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr on your preferred IDE.
   - Make sure to include the necessary dependencies for web development, such as Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.

2. Define Your Entity Class:
   - Create a Java class representing the `CloudVendor` entity. Annotate it with `@Entity` to indicate that it's a JPA entity.
   - Define attributes like `id`, `name`, `address`, `number`, etc., along with appropriate annotations such as `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`.

3. Create a Repository Interface:
   - Create a repository interface for the `CloudVendor` entity by extending `JpaRepository<CloudVendor, String>`.
   - This interface will provide CRUD operations out of the box, thanks to Spring Data JPA.

4. Implement Controller for CRUD Operations:
   - Create a controller class to handle HTTP requests related to the Cloud Vendor entity.
   - Annotate the class with `@RestController` to indicate that it's a controller.
   - Implement methods for handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using appropriate annotations (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`).
   - Inject the repository interface created earlier into the controller and use it to perform CRUD operations.

5. Annotations in Spring:
   - In Spring, you can use annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` to map HTTP requests to specific methods in your controller class.
   - Additionally, you can use annotations like `@RequestBody` to bind request data to method parameters, and `@PathVariable` to extract values from the URI.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of Spring Boot, you can easily create a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on a Cloud Vendor table in your database.
